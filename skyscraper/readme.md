# **Skyscrapers**
Logic games have forever been a passion of mine. This is just a small side project I made trying to replicate an old favorite of mine and improve my HTML/CSS/JS skills, as a recent Dev Student.

You can give it a try at https://smartiepinheiro.github.io/skyscraper/

### Game rules

For the unfamiliar the goal of **Skyscrapers** is to **place a skyscraper in each square**, with a height between 1 and 6, so that **no two skyscrapers in a row or column have the same height**.

The numbers in **white** tell you the **number of visible skyscrapers from that place.** 

Note that **higher skyscrapers block the view of lower skyscrapers** located behind them.

Imagine it like the image bellow:
