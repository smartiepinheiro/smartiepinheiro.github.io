# **Color Flip**
Logic games have forever been a passion of mine. This is just a small side project I made to improve my HTML/CSS/JS skills, as a recent Dev Student.

You can give it a try at https://smartiepinheiro.github.io/color_flip/

### Game rules

For the unfamiliar the goal of **Color Flip** is to **make all the cells one single color.**.

The cells can be either **red** or **green**. When you **click on one it changes to the opposite color**.

The catch is, **so do the cells around** (up, down, left, right). As an example:

### Features

✔️ Random generated solution every time;   
✔️ Each and every game is solvable, the beginning colors are not just random;   
✔️ Win after the cells are either all red or all green;   
✔️ 'Games won' stores the numbers of wins in the cookies and displays it to the user;    
✔️ 'Current Time' timer, that starts with the first table click;  
✔️ 'Current Time' resets on every game;  
✔️ 'Highscore' time stored in the cookies, that updates and displays the user's fastest win time.  
✔️ Play Again button that reloads the game;  
✔️ Responsive to window resize: allows horizontal/vertical play.
